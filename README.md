# Vulner

## Objective
This project is designed to simulate the mindset and methods of a potential attacker. By scanning the network, identifying vulnerabilities, and attempting to exploit them, Individuals can gain a deeper understanding of the network's weaknesses. This isn't just about finding holes in the system; it's about learning how an attacker might think and act, so we can strengthen our defenses.

#### Project Structuring and Modularity:

- Structuring a project into distinct modules (e.g., user input handling, weak credential detection, vulnerability mapping) to enhance maintainability and clarity of the code.

#### Use of Pre-built Tools and Custom Scripts:

- Learning how to effectively combine pre-built security tools and custom scripts to create an integrated penetration testing system.

#### Cybersecurity Automation Techniques:

- Building foundational knowledge in cybersecurity automation, especially focusing on tasks that benefit from reduced manual intervention to enhance security coverage and efficiency.

## Methodologies

The methodologies used in this project are focused on systematically identifying and evaluating the security posture of the network. The approach is divided into several stages, each utilizing specific tools and techniques to gather information, assess vulnerabilities, and attempt exploitation. The following sections detail the steps taken during the assessment.

### Network Scanning
* Method:
    * The script scans the network for open TCP ports and identifies the services running on them using Nmap. The scan aims to provide essential details about active services within the specified network range.

* Tools Used:
    * Nmap: Utilized for discovering open ports and identifying the services running on those ports. The script does not use NSE
    scripts.

* Command Example:
    * `Basic Scan: nmap -sS -sV {network_range}`

### Vulnerability Assessment

* Method:
    * The script identifies potential vulnerabilities by using service versions discovered in the network scan and cross-referencing them with known exploits.

* Tools Used:
    * Searchsploit: A command-line interface for the Exploit-DB database, allowing the script to find known exploits for the detected service versions.

* Command Example:
    * `searchsploit {service_version}`

### Brute-force Attacks

* Method:
    * This method tests for weak or default credentials on selected services by attempting multiple username and password combinations.

* Tools Used:
    * Hydra: A versatile tool for performing brute-force attacks on services such as SSH, FTP, RDP, and Telnet.

* Command Example:
    * `hydra -L {username_list} -P {password_list} {ip} {service} -s {port}`

#### Logging and Reporting

* Method:
    * All results from network scans, vulnerability assessments, and brute-force attacks are logged in a structured format. The script also offers options to search through these logs or compress them for further use.

* Tools Used:
    * Text Files: For storing results.
    * Grep: A command-line utility for searching within the results.
    * Zip Utility: For compressing all results into a single file.

* Command Example:
    * Search: `grep {search_term} {output_file}`
    * Zip: `zip -r scan_results.zip {output_directory}`

### Tool Management

* Method:
    * Ensures that all necessary tools are installed and up-to-date. This method checks for missing tools and installs them if necessary.

* Tools Used:
    * Apt-get (Linux Package Manager): Used for installing and updating system tools.
    * Pip (Python Package Installer): For managing Python packages.

* Command Example:
    * System Tools: `sudo apt-get install {missing_tools}`
    * Python Packages: `pip install {missing_packages}`

## Discussion

Tools Check and Installation
Overview
In the initial phase of the script, the goal is to ensure that all the necessary tools and Python packages are installed and up to date. This is crucial for the rest of the script to function correctly, as missing tools would cause errors later in the process.
